        <P>
            Thank you  &nbsp;for shortlisting my application for the Trainee Software Engineer position. I am very excited about the opportunity to interview with your team.</P>
        <p>
            However, I encountered an issue when trying to schedule my interview using the provided link. It shows "No availability during these days" when I attempt to book a slot. Could you please assist me in scheduling the interview? Alternatively, if there are specific dates and times available, I would be happy to confirm one of those.<br>
            
            Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
