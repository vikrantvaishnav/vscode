    <h1><strong>Using Quotation and Citation Tags in HTML</strong></h1>
    <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <q>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q>
        <cite> <strong>//this is a blockquoted text</strong></cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say: //<strong>this is paragraph</strong>
</p>
    <q>To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</q><Strong>//this is quoted text</Strong>

    <p>This quote is widely attributed to <em>Albert Einstein.</em>//<strong>this is a citation tag.</strong></p>

<p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly.For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>//<strong>this is a citation tag.</strong></br>
    by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.
</p>
<p>Another classic example can be seen in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em><strong>//this is a citation tag.</strong></br>
by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.
