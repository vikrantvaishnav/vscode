    <h1>HTML Presentational and Formatting Tags: An In-Depth Look
    </h1>
    <p>
      This page provides an extensive demonstration of various HTML tags
      specifically designed for text formatting and presentation. It highlights
      how these tags influence the visual appearance and semantic meaning of
      content without relying on external CSS.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Text Styling and Emphasis Tags</h2>
    <p>
      These tags are used to apply common text styles like bold, italic,
      underline, and to convey different levels of emphasis or semantic meaning.
    </p>
    <h3>Bold and Strong Emphasis</h3>
    <p>
      This sentence contains text that is rendered in a
      <strong>bold</strong> font style using the b tag. The b tag is typically
      used for visually bolding text without adding any special semantic
      importance.<br />
      Conversely, this sentence has text that conveys
      <strong>strong importance</strong> using the strong tag. While it often
      renders as bold, its primary purpose is to indicate that the content in of
      greater importance or seriousness.<br />
      Consider using strong for keywords in a warning or critical information,
      and b for names in an article or product names that don't need semantic
      emphasis
    </p>
    <h3>Italic and Emphasized Text</h3>
    <p>
      Here, we have text that is displayed in an <i>italic</i> font using the i
      tag. The i tag is generally used for text that needs to stand out
      vimially, such as technical terms, foreign words, or thoughts.<br />
      This sentence showcases text that is <em>emphasized</em> using the em tag.
      The em tag adds semantic emphasis, implying that the content should be
      stressed or pronounced differently.<br />
      For instance, une em when you want to emphasize a word in a sentence to
      change its meaning, and i for titles of works or scientific names
    </p>

    <h3>Underlined and Inserted Text</h3>
    <p>
      This text is <u>underlined</u> using the u tag. Historically, this was
      used for visual underlining, but it's now often discouraged for
      non-hyperlink text to avoid confusion. It can be used to represent text
      that is unarticulated but explicitly rendered as if underlined, such as
      misspellings.<br />
      This text is <ins>inserted</ins> using the ins tag. This tag semantically
      indicates content that has been added to a document, often rendered with
      an underline You can also specify a datetime attribute for ins to indicate
      when the content was inserted:
      <ins>New content added on Jan 15.2023.</ins>
    </p>

    <h3>Strikethrough and Deleted Text</h3>
    <p>
      This text is <s>struck through</s> using the stag. This tag indicates
      content that is no longer accurate or relevant, but should not be removed
      from the document. It's purely presentational.<br />
      This text is <del>deleted</del> using the del tag. This tag semantically
      indicates content that has been removed from a document, often rendered
      with a strikethrough.<br />
      Similar to ina, del can also have a datetime attribute:
      <del>Old price $29.99</del> New price: $24.99.
    </p>

    <h3>Subscript and Superscript</h3>
    <p>
      Chemical formulas often use subscripts, like H<sub>2</sub>O (water) where the 2' is a
      sub elemenit.<br />
      Mathematical expressions or ordinal indicators use superscripts, such as
      E=mc<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup>, where the '2' and 'th' are sup elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Marked (Highlighted) Text</h3>
    <p><p>The mark tag is used to <mark>highlight</mark> or mark text that is of particular relevance in the context of the surrounding content, often rendered with a yellow background.</p></p>

    <h3>Small Text</h3>
    <p>This is normal text, and this is <small>small</small> text using the small tag. It typically represents side comments, copyright, or legal disclaimers.</p>

    <h3>Cited Work</h3>
    <p>The cite tag is used to denote the title of a work. For example, as famously quoted from <cite>Hamlet</cite> by William Shakespeare, "To be or not to be, that is the question."<br/>
    Another example: The theory was first proposed in <cite>On the Origin of Species</cite></p>
    <hr/>

    <h2>Code, Variables, and Preformatted Text</h2>
    <p>These tags are crucial for displaying programming code, user input, sample output, and preserving text formatting</p>

    <h3>Code Snippets</h3>
    <p>For inline code, use the code tag. For example, to print "Hello, World!" in Python, you would use <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>.<br/>
    When defining a function in JavaScript: <code>function greet() { console.log("Hi!"); }</code></p>

    <h3>Keyboard Input</h3>
    <p>The kbd tag indicates user input, typically from a keyboard. To save a document, press <kbd>Ctrl + s</kbd>.<br/>
    To open the task manager on Windows, press <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</kbd>.</p>

    <h3>Sample Output</h3>
    <p>The samp tag represents sample output from a computer program. If the command fails, you might see: Error: Permission denied.
    After a successful compilation, the console might display: <samp>Build successful (0 warnings, 0 errors)</samp>.</p>

    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>The var tag is used to define a variable in a mathematical expression or programming context. In the formula for the area of a circle, A = <var>arÂ²</var>, A represents the area and represents the radius.<br/>
    Another example: Let <var>x</var> be the number of apples.</p>

    <h3>Preformatted Text</h3>
    <p>The pre tag preserves whitespace and line breaks exactly as they are written in the HTML source code, making it ideal for displaying code blocks or ASCII art.<br/>
    <pre>
        function example(data){
            if (data null){
                return "No data";
            }
            return data.length;
        }
        This is simple
        multi-line
        text block.
    </pre>  
    </p>
    <hr/>

    <h2>Quotes and Blockquotes</h2>
    <p>These tags are used for quoting text from other sources, distinguishing between short inline quotes and longer, block-level quotes</p>
    <h3>Short Quotes</h3>
    <p>The q tag is used for short, inline quotations. My friend said, <q>I'll be there in five minutes!</q> before hanging up.<br/>
    Another common phrase is, <q>Actions speak louder than words</q></p>

    <h3>Blockquotes</h3>
    <p>The blockquote tag is used for longer quotations that are typically displayed as a block. It often includes a citation.
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;"
-Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken
This blockquote demonstrates how a larger section of quoted text is rendered, typically with indentation, and can include a citation using the cite tag.</p>
